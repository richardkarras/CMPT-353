Relational Model

Intro:
History:
-E.F. Codd
	A relational model of data for large shared databanks (1970)
-Set-Theory model (Childs, 1968)
-Goals of the RM (relational model)
	-high degree of data independence
	-theory of basic problems e.g. consisency, redundancy (normalization)
	-use of set-oriented data manipulation

Terminology:
Common Terminology		Relational Terminology
Table					Relation
Record or Row			Tuple
Field or Column			Attribute
Number of Columns		Degree
Number of Rows			Cardinality
Identifier				Primary Key
Proof of legal values	Domain

RM vs Relational DBMS
	-There are differences between RM and relational DBMS
		-RM no duplicate tuples
		-Domains
		-etc...
		
Domain
	-pool of values (like a type)
	-values are atomic
	-domains have names
		-unique in database
		-are set of values
		-different domains can overlap
	-e.g. {white, red, blue, green}
	
Relation 1
-Relations consist of heading and body
-Heading
	-fixed set of attributes
		-e.g. {<A1:D1>,<A2,D2>,...,<AN:DN>}
-Body
	-set of tuples
		-e.g. {T1, T2, TN}
	-Tuple
		-{<A1:V1>,<A2:V2>,...,<AN:VN>}
Relation 2
-Heading for relation S
	-{bno, street, city, country}
	-{
		<bno : DOMAIN-BNO>
		<street : DOMAIN-STREET>
		<city : DOMAIN-CITY>
		<country : DOMAIN-COUNTRY>
	 }
 Relation 3
 -Tuple
	-{b1, 110 Money Road, London, UK}
	-{
		<bno : 'b1'>
		<street : '110 Money Road'>
		<city : 'London'>
		<country : 'UK'>
	 }
	 
 Relation 4
 We interpret as humans the relation
 Difference between relation and table
	-relation -> abstract
	-relation -> linked to set theory
	-table -> concrete thing
	-table -> allows duplicate tuples
Relation 5
-Table -> suggest order
	>> tupel
	>> attributes
But! there is no order of tuples or atributes!
Relation 6

Operations:
Relation -> Relation
Operations
	-selection
	-projection
	-cartesian product
	-union
	-intersection
	-differences
	-join(s)
	-division
