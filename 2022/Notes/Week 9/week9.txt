protocol://host:port/path/{args} instead of protocol:://host:port/path?args -> typo should have been protocol://host:port/path?args

NoSQL 1

Why
-Massive increase in new data
-Storage
-Unstructured data
-SQL
	-B-Tree
	-Support fast reads
-NoSQL
	-LSM - Log Structured Merge Tree
	-Support fast writes
	
Storing Data in SQL(high-level)
-Binary Tree
	-O(n) -> space
	-Search/Insert/Delete ?
	-Balanced Tree (B-tree)
		-O(n) -> space
		-O(log(n)) for search/insert/delete
-B-Tree of order M
	-Rudolf Bayer, Edward M. McCreight
	-Balanced Tree
	-All nodes have at most M child nodes
	-Every internal node has at least 2 child nodes
	-All leaf nodes are on the same level
	-Every non-leaf node with K children has K-1 trees
-Nodes in a B-Tree
	-Internal/Inner Nodes
		-All nodes that are not root or leaf
		-Root Nodes
		-Leaf Nodes
SQL -> Use of B-Trees
	-Fast reads
	-
	-
NoSQL -> LSM
-Writes in LSM
	-Write to memtable
	-Ordered by key
	-Balanced Binary Tree
-If memtable is full -> write to disk as immutable sorted string table (SST)
	-Key value pairs stored in sorted sequence
	-Fast write -> sequential write
	-Last SST is most recent segment of LSM tree
Immutable SST???
-Updates
	-New entry added into new SST
-Delete
	-Add marker (tombstone)
-Read
	-check memtable
	-Search SST starting with most recent SST
		-SSTN -> SST1
		-SST -> sorted -> fast reads
Problem of SST growth
	-Compacting and Merging
	-Merging is simple (merging sorted items) => merge sort
